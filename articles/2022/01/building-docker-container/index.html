Docker containers are a pretty cool way to deploy programs.
I've used other peoples' docker contairs quite a bit, but now wanted to make my own. Here's how that went.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
I tried packaging an IRC bot I had written in go, the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pvpublic/uptodatebot/src/master/">UpToDateBot</a>.
What it does isn't super relevant. Its needs are very simple, making it a good choice for my first container.
It needs one config file, <code>config.yaml</code> in <code>/etc/uptodatebot</code>. It doesn't need any ports exposed to it.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
To get a complete docker container from my go source code, I would need to first build the code, then copy it over to a container. The config file stuff can all be handled when running the container, since the config file resides on my host's filesystem anyway.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
At first, I thought I would start easy by building the executable on my host machine, and copying the binary to the root of the container in my Dockerfile. I had heard of Alpine Linux being one of the lightest options for container OSs, so I went with that.
Here's what I started with in my Dockerfile:
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph"><div class="article-code"><code>FROM alpine:latest

COPY ./UpToDateBot /

RUN mkdir /etc/uptodatebot

WORKDIR /etc/uptodatebot
CMD [ "/UpToDateBot" ]</code></div></p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
I set the <code>WORKDIR</code> to <code>/etc/uptodatebot</code> because that's where I intended to put the config file, and the executable searches for it only in the directory in which it is run.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Building and running:
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph"><div class="article-code"><code>docker build -t uptodatebot .
docker run -v $PWD/config.yaml:/etc/uptodatebot/config.yaml uptodatebot</code></div></p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Now of course, this didn't work at all. Alpine just complained that it couldn't find the executable.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph"><div class="article-code"><code>exec /UpToDateBot: no such file or directory</code></div></p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
When running with the interactive shell flag (<code>docker run -v ... -it uptodatebot sh</code>), I found out that the executable had indeed been copied correctly.
I then remembered the memes about Alpine not being GNU/Linux. <em>Of course!</em>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
I had build my executable on my openSUSE Tumbleweed machine, which uses <code>glibc</code>. Alpine doesn't use GNU software, so it has <code>musl</code>. It can't run executables that link to <code>glibc</code> like mine does.
I'm guessing that the vague error was due to the lightweight nature of Alpine
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
I then tried the next best thing, by building the container <code>FROM debian:latest</code> instead. That too failed, this time because openSUSE's <code>glibc</code> version is newer than, and incompatible with, the version shipped with Debian.
Building the container <code>FROM opensuse/tumbleweed:latest</code>, it worked!
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
But this was just the first step. I wanted a full build setup that built the executable binary in one container and copied the executables to a final one, so that things would largely be architecture-agnostic, and not dependent on the host machine's OS.
I stubled upon the <code>golang</code> container, which contained a full environment for building, with tools like git preinstalled.
All I had to do was create a directory for my build, clone the git repo, build the executable, and copy it over to a fresh container. This was done pretty easily, after some research.
I took the opportunity to add a personal touch to the product too.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph"><div class="article-code"><code>FROM golang:latest as buildcontainer

WORKDIR /build
RUN git clone https://PrithviVishak@bitbucket.org/pvpublic/uptodatebot.git
WORKDIR /build/uptodatebot
RUN go build -o UpToDateBot

FROM debian:latest
LABEL maintainer="Prithvi Vishak <prithvivishak@gmail.com>"

COPY --from=buildcontainer /build/uptodatebot/UpToDateBot /

WORKDIR /etc/uptodatebot
CMD [ "/UpToDateBot" ]</code></div></p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
As it turns out, the golang container's <code>glibc</code> version is compatible with Debian's. This was near ideal. The last thing I wanted was it to run in Alpine.
After yet more research, I found that Alpine has a package called <code>gcompat</code>, which allows <code>glibc</code> programs to run properly. And indeed it did. Here's the final result:
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph"><div class="article-code"><code>FROM golang:latest as buildcontainer

WORKDIR /build
RUN git clone https://PrithviVishak@bitbucket.org/pvpublic/uptodatebot.git
WORKDIR /build/uptodatebot
RUN go build -o UpToDateBot

FROM alpine:latest as uptodatebot
LABEL maintainer="Prithvi Vishak &lt;prithvi@example.com&gt;"

COPY --from=buildcontainer /build/uptodatebot/UpToDateBot /
RUN apk add --no-cache gcompat

WORKDIR /etc/uptodatebot
CMD [ "/UpToDateBot" ]</code></div></p>
